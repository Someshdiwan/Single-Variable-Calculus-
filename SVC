What is SVC (Single Variable Calculus)?

Single Variable Calculus (SVC) is a branch of calculus that deals with functions of a single independent variable. It focuses on understanding and analyzing the behavior of these functions using the concepts of differentiation and integration.

Key Concepts in SVC:

1. Functions of One Variable:**
   - A function (f(x)) depends on a single variable ( x).
   - Example: (f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 ).

2. Limits:
   - The value a function approaches as the input ( x ) approaches a certain point.
   - Example: (lim{x to 2} (x^2 + 3x) = 10).

3. Differentiation:
   - The process of finding the rate of change (slope) of a function at a point.
   - Example: If (f(x) = x^2), the derivative is (f'(x) = 2x).
   
   - Applications:
     - Finding maxima and minima.
     - Analyzing the slope of tangents.
     - Velocity and acceleration in physics.

4. Integration:
   - The process of finding the area under the curve of a function or the reverse operation of differentiation.
   - Example: The integral of (f(x) = x^2) is (int x^2 dx = {x^3}{3} + C).
   
   - Applications:
     - Calculating areas and volumes.
     - Solving differential equations.
     - Accumulating quantities like distance or energy.

5. Applications:
   - Physics: Motion, forces, and energy analysis.
   - Economics: Optimization of profit and cost functions.
   - Biology: Modeling growth and decay.
   - Engineering: Analyzing stress and strain in materials.

Why is SVC Important?
SVC provides foundational tools to model and solve real-world problems involving change and accumulation. 
It builds the groundwork for more advanced calculus topics, such as multivariable calculus, differential equations, and vector calculus.
